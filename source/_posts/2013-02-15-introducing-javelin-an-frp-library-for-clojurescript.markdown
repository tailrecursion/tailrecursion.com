We are pleased to announce today the release of
[Javelin](https://github.com/tailrecursion/javelin), a new
[Functional Reactive Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming)
(FRP) library for
[ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript).

* [Javelin README](https://github.com/tailrecursion/javelin/blob/master/README.md) - short examples and operational overview
* [tailrecursion/javelin-demos](https://github.com/tailrecursion/javelin-demos) - evolving set of more involved examples
* [see the demos running online](http://tailrecursion.com/~alan/javelin-demos/)

Javelin takes a hybrid approach to FRP that draws inspiration from the
spreadsheet model, various existing FRP libraries and frameworks,
Clojure, and some of our own observations about the nature of
reactivity in web applications.

While Javelin is a work in progress, our experience using it so far
has been extremely positive.  We're confident in the Javelin model and
welcome your feedback, bug reports, and pull requests as we work to
prepare Javelin for our own production use.
